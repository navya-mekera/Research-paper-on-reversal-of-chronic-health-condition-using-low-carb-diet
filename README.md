The possibility that healthy diet can induce healing effects to not only prevent and reverse chronic illnesses but also cure an already advanced condition, and the right food intake can be a potential replacement to pharmaceutical methods of treatment which are often needed for life and cause significant side effects, requires serious investigation.

The data was used to perform quantitative descriptive analytics to depict the summary of information gathered from the questionnaire.
